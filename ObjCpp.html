<b>objcpp.h</b> is a C++ header file which wraps pointers to instances of the
core foundation classes NSArray, NSDictionary and NSString in simple C++ classes
to facilitate the use of operator overloading. Once this has been done the
implementation of operators such as [] for arrays (and dictionaries) and
&quot;+&quot; for strings can be defined to extend the syntax of the Objective-C
language.&nbsp;<p>As a convenient side effect, the assignment operator can also now be
overloaded so objcpp.h
can take the responsibility for managing reference counting and controlling object
life-cycle off the programmer's hands in a manner arguably more consistent than
the @property construct of Objective-C II and more memory efficient than the &quot;autorelease&quot;
mechanism.</p>
<p><b>objcpp.h</b> is implemented entirely as inline functions within the header
file and effectively operates as a pre-processor. Therefore, all that is required to use it is to add the files objcpp.h and the
supporting file objstr.h to your project and #import &quot;objcpp.h&quot; into
your source. The&nbsp; last step is to change the &quot;File Type&quot; for source files that import objcpp.h
to &quot;<i><b>sourcecode.cpp.objcpp</b></i>&quot; on the &quot;General&quot; tab of
the &quot;Get Info&quot; inspector in Xcode. This switches the compiler to mixed
language &quot;Objective-C++&quot; compilation.</p>
<p>You can then make use of the C++ wrapper classes <b>OOArray</b>, <b> OODictionary</b> and
<b>
OOString</b> much as you would their foundation counterparts except they have a
number of handy operators available. For example, using <b>OOString</b>:&nbsp;<pre>#import &quot;objcpp.h&quot;
...
    OOString str = @&quot;Hello&quot;;
    str = str + @&quot; World&quot;;
    NSLog( @&quot;Message: %@, length %d == %d&quot;, 
           *str, [*str length], [str length] );</pre>

<p>In objcpp the * operator is used to gain access to the Objective-C pointer wrapped by
a class. As of gcc 4.2 (the default compiler in the iPhone 3.0 SDK), wrapped
pointers can be messaged directly without using the * operator as a
cast to type to the type
&quot;id&quot; is available in the class.

<p><b>OOArray</b> and <b>OODictionary</b> are C++ template classes that take
the contained object's class as a parameter:<pre>    OOArray&lt;NSString *&gt; array;
    array[0] = @&quot;First element&quot;;
    array[1] = @&quot;Second element&quot;;
    array += @&quot;Third element&quot;;</pre>

The <b>OODictionary</b> class is the same but you use an object for the
subscript which is used as the key. To cut a long story short, the way the three
core classes fit together, subscripting can be applied recursively, OOArrays can
be sparse and you can use OOString as the contained class so the following
compiles and executes correctly:<pre>    OODictionary&lt;OOString&gt; dictionary;
    dictionary[@&quot;KEY&quot;][1][@&quot;KEY&quot;] = @&quot;Hello&quot;;
    dictionary[@&quot;KEY&quot;][1][@&quot;KEY&quot;] += @&quot; World!&quot;;</pre>

<p>This recursive syntax is used in &quot;<b>objxml.h&quot;</b> when parsing and
constructing XML messages. Also included with the <b> OOString</b> class are operators for <b> regular expressions</b>.
For
example: replacing any occurrences of the word &quot;Hello&quot;
with &quot;Good-bye&quot; in a string...
<pre>    OOString text = @&quot;Hello World&quot;;
    text |= @&quot;/Hello/Good-bye/&quot;;</pre>

<p>This is the shortest&nbsp; of introductions to objcpp.h some details of which are
described below. Other sources of information are the HTML documentation at the
location above and the unit tests and example iPhone application in the release 
(as well as the source itself.)</p>

<td width='50%' valign=top style='border-left: 2px inset'>
<b>objsql.h</b>  is an Objective-C module which binds Objective-C classes
to a sqlite3 relational database for persistent storage.
Objects can be inserted, selected, updated and deleted by using messages. The binding of
the instance variables of record classes to database columns and creation of the
underlying database table is handled by the <b> objsql.mm</b> implementation - no SQL
knowledge is required.<p>

At the highest level, to use objsql.h: add it and the supporting files objcpp.h,
objstr.h and objsql.mm to your project, create record classes and send one of the
following messages to instances of your record classes:

<pre>    [record insert];
    [record update]; // call before updating
    [record delete];</pre>

To commit your changes to the database call <tt>[OODatabase commit]</tt> to
perform the actual updates. The record class can be any Objective-C
sublcass of the abstract superclass <b>OORecord</b> which implements these
insert/update/delete methods. The supported types for instance variables are:

<ul>
<li> all the basic C types, int, char, float, double etc. and NSString *, NSData *
<li>any type which can be archived into NSData e.g. NSArrays and NSDictionarys etc.
<li>the <b> objcpp.h</b>  core types: OOString, OOArray and OODictionary.
</ul>

Column (instance variable) names follow the following key convention: if the instance variable
 name begins with an upper case letter, the associated column on the database will be indexed
and can be used in "natural joins" where the column names match from one class to another
.
For example two classes "Authors" and "Pictures" which share a column 
"Author_ID" are considered to be related by a natural join. You can insert
records for each of these classes then, for an Author record, use the
following methods to select an Author's Picture records and select the
Author instance associated with the first picture record:

<pre>    OOArray&lt;Pictures *&gt; pics = 
    [Pictures selectRecordsRelatedTo:authorRecord];
        
    OORef&lt;Authors *&gt; auth = 
    [Authors selectRecordsRelatedTo:*pics[0]][0];</pre>

Whether the join results in more than one record is not decided by the
framework but you can place a primary key or&nbsp; other constraints by
implementing one of the methods in the <tt>OOTableCustomization</tt> protocol in your class:

<pre>@implementation Author
+ (NSString *)ooTableName { return &quot;AUTHOR_TABLE&quot;; }
+ (NSString *)ooTableKey { return @&quot;Author_ID&quot;;}
@end</pre>

The table associated with a record class and it's sqlite3 database 
are created automatically when the class is first messaged. For more complex joins
or views involving, for example, aggregates use the customization method <tt>+ ooTableSql</tt> to specify 
the SQL to be used to create the view. It can then be selected into instances
of the record class as you would a from a table. <p>

Finally, any record instance can be bound user interface components using the following method:

<pre>    [record bindToView:uiView delegate:self];</pre>

This statement uses the integer tag number of any subviews of uiView to
determine the instance variable of the record class (the first instance variable
having tag number 1) associated with that view. The view's &quot;.text&quot;
property is then updated with the value of the instance variable. This can be used for <tt>UITableViewCells</tt> or for editors/inspectors which use the delegate methods of the UI components to determine when values have
changed. For further details take a look at the &quot;ObjSql&quot; example
project&nbsp; for the iPhone SDK.

<p><b>objxml.h</b> is an extension of objcpp.h to parse and construct XML messages.
The&nbsp; messages are represented to the developer as a tree of <b>OONode</b> objects,
one for
each XML element&nbsp;in the document. Each <b>OONode</b> is implemented a
subclass of <b>OODictionary&lt;OOString&gt;</b> and contains the attributes of
the element stored under the keys &quot;<b>@attributeName</b>&quot;. Each OONode
also has any child OONode sub-elements or OOString text in an array under the
special key &quot;.<b>children</b>&quot;.</p>
<p>An incoming document is parsed using the constructor or by assignment from an
NSData object containing the xml message text.</p>
<pre>NSData *text = [NSData dataWithContentsOfURL:aURL];
OONode doc( text, OOXMLRecursive );
// or
doc = text;</pre>

<p>Components of the message are then accessed using a limited version of <b>xpath</b>
syntax and casting:</p>
<pre>// retrieve attribute of root node
OOString attr = doc[@&quot;element/@attribute&quot;];

// retrieve root node itself
OONode root = doc[@&quot;element&quot;];

// retrieve array of all children of root
OONodeArray children = doc[@&quot;element/*&quot;];

// retrieve all &quot;item&quot; elements in doc.
// &quot;OOXMLRecursive&quot; option required
OONodeArray items = doc[@&quot;//item&quot;];</pre>

As it is a subclass of OODictionary&lt;OOString&gt; all xpath expressions return
a string by default which is the text value of the element's contents. Casts are
available however to return the actual nodes. You can explicitly convert the
return value and following are valid and equivalent:<pre>OONodeArray nodes;
OONode node;
nodes = doc[@&quot;element&quot;].children();
nodes = doc[@&quot;element/*&quot;].nodes();
node = doc[@&quot;element/child/0&quot;];
node = doc[@&quot;element/child&quot;][0];
node = doc[@&quot;element/child&quot;].node();
node = doc[@&quot;element/child&quot;].node( 0 );
node = doc[@&quot;element/child&quot;].nodes()[0];</pre>

<p>This process works in reverse to construct XML documents which can then be
converted to message text using the writeXML() method. Constructing an XML
document is as simple as:</p>
<pre>ONode doc;
doc[@&quot;element/message&quot;] = @&quot;Message text.&quot;;
doc[@&quot;element/@attr&quot;] = &quot;Attribute value&quot;;
doc[@&quot;element/@xmlns&quot;] = &quot;http://namespaceurl&quot;;
NSData *message = &amp;doc.writeXML( OXMLPrettyPrint );</pre>

<h3>Contents of the Release</h3>
<p>The release contains three Xcode projects for testing and to demonstrate the
use of the toolkit.</p>
<h4>ObjCpp/ObjCpp.xcodeproj</h4>
<p>This project contains the <b>obj*.h</b> file source and unit tests to
validate the operation of the toolkit after it has been downloaded. Build and
run the project to see the instructions on how to use <b>objcpp.h</b> in a
project.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>ObjSql/ObjSql.xcodeproj</h4>
<p><b>ObjSql</b> is an example iPhone application that demonstrates the use of
various features of the <b>objsql.h</b> component of the toolkit. ObjSql builds
a small sqlite3 database from text flat files and displays them as a navigation
based iPhone application. The records in the database are fetched into instances
of the classes defined in <b>RecordClasses.[hm]</b>. These classes have common
instance variable names that form natural joins amongst themselves in various
ways which are detected by the toolkit as the classes are registered.</p>
<p>The first screen displays a list of all tables and selecting one of the
tables displays row in that table. The cells of the UITableView are generated by
copying a prototype view for that record class and their values populated
automatically on the basis of the tag number of the UI component in the
prototype. Records can be deleted using the &quot;Edit&quot; button.<br>
<br>
Selecting an individual record will display all tables which contains records
which can be joined to that record and its table and selecting that table will
show the joined records. The tables also join to themselves and if you select
the self-join an inspector will displayed which allows you to edit the values in
the record to demonstrate the use of the toolkit for updates.</p>
<h4>ObjXml/ObjXml.xcodeproj</h4>
<p>The <b>ObjXml</b> project exercises the <b>objxml.h</b> XML message parser
displaying the top 100 new entries from the iTunes RSS feed. Data is fetched
using code something like the following:</p>
<pre>OOXMLSaxParser parser( OXMLRecursive );
NSData * message = &amp;OOURL( &quot;<a href="http://url...">http://url...</a>&quot; ).data();
parser.parse( message ):
OONode doc = parser.rootNodeForXMLData();</pre>

<p>Something different then happens. The items nodes are then selected out of
the document as OODictionary&lt;OOString&gt; instances containing element values
rather than OONodes using the &quot;<b>.dictionaries()</b>&quot; method. This
allows the data to be imported onto instances of the &quot;<b>iTunesItem.[hm]</b>&quot;
class using the <b>OOMetaData</b> class of the objsql.h toolkit and then
automatically bound to UITableView cells using a prototype as in the ObjSql
project.</p>
<pre>OOStringDictionaries items = doc[@&quot;//items&quot;].dictionaries();
OOArray&lt;iTunesItem *&gt; rows = 
[OOMetaData import:items intoClass:[iTunesItem class]];
// to then save to a sqlite3 database
[OODatabase insertArray:rows];
[OODatabase commit];</pre>

<td width='50%' valign=top>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>objcpp.h is based around a fourth core C++ class <b>OOReference</b> of which
OOString, OOArray and OODictionary are subclasses. It is defined in general
terms as follows:&nbsp;</p>
<pre>template &lt;typename <i>ObjectClass</i>&gt;
class OOReference {
    <i>ObjectClass</i> *reference;
protected:
    <i>ObjectClass</i> *set( <i>ObjectClass</i> *newReference ) {
        [newReference retain];
        [reference release];
        return reference = newReference;
    }
public:
    OOReference() { 
        reference = nil;
    }
    ObjectClass *operator * () const {
        return reference;
    }
    ~OOReference() {
        set( nil );
    }
};</pre>

<p>Using this class as it's base, the <b>OOString</b> class is defined as something like the following:</p>
<pre>class OOString : public OOReference&lt;NSMutableString&gt; {
public:
    OOString &amp;operator = ( const OOString &amp;str ) {
        set( *str );
        return *this;
    }
};</pre>

Using this basic pattern the semantics of the objcpp classes emerge. Each class
is a wrapper for a pointer to the underlying foundation class instance. On
assignment the new object is retained and any previous value for
&quot;reference&quot; is released. To gain access to the underlying object the
operator * is used. Finally, when a variable declared as OOString goes out
of scope, it's destructor is called and the reference is released by using the set() function to assign nil. The underlying object
may be dealloc'd as a result depending on it's reference count.<p>It's worth digressing at this point to consider what happens when an OOString
variable is defined as an instance variable of an Objective-C class. Since gcc
4.2 (the default in SDK 3.0+) the option <b> &quot;-fobjc-call-cxx-cdtors&quot; </b> is turned on by default. This
option arranges for the constructors of instance variables which are C++ classes
to be called when the containing Objective-C class's &quot;alloc&quot; method is
called. Likewise when dealloc is called, the destructors of any C++ class
instance variables are themselves called. This means, if you use OOString instead of
NSString * for an
instance variables it's memory will automatically be recovered when an
object is deallocated avoiding the need to take care to define a
&quot;dealloc&quot; method to recover any retained objects.

<td width='50%' valign=top style='border-left: 2px inset'>
<h3>Subscripting</h3>
<p>The implementation of subscripting in objcpp.h is a little more involved. If
the goal was to have read-only access to containers <b>OOArray</b> could have
been defined very simply as follows:</p>
<pre>template class OOArray&lt;<i>ElementClass</i>&gt;
class OOArray : OOReference&lt;NSMutableArray&gt; {
public:
    OOString &amp;operator = ( const OOArray &amp;arr ) {
        set( *arr );
        return *this;
    }
    <i>ElementClass</i> *operator [] ( int idx ) {
        return [**this objectAtIndex:idx];
    }
};</pre>

To allow assignment to a subscripted expression however, the result of an
expressions array[i] needs to remember from where it was derived. To 
capture this a transient private class <b>OOSubscript</b> is used to store this information.<pre>template class OOSubscript&lt;<i>ElementClass</i>&gt;
class OOSubscript {
    NSMutableArray *arr;
    int idx;
    OOSubscript( NSMutableArray *arr, int idx ) {
	this-&gt;arr = arr;
	this-&gt;idx = idx;
    }
    friend class OOArray&lt;ElementClass&gt;;
public:
    <i>ElementClass</i> *operator * () const {
        return [arr objectAtIndex:idx];
    }
    OOSubscript &amp;operator = ( <i>ElementClass</i> *elm ) {
        [arr replaceObjectAtIndex:idx withObject:elm];
    }
};</pre>

As a result the implementation of the operator [] for OOArray is more like the
following:<pre>    OOSubscript&lt;<i>ElementClass</i>&gt; operator [] ( int idx ) {
        return OOSubscript&lt;<i>ElementClass</i>&gt;( **this, idx );
    }</pre>

In this way the code <tt>array[0] = @&quot;A String&quot;;</tt> is implemented. As before, the expression &quot;array[i]&quot; is an instance of a C++
wrapper class so you can use the &quot;*&quot; operator to gain access to it's
actual value. In objcpp.h there are four subclasses of OOSubscript. One
each for OOArrays and OODictionarys, for subscripts of OOArrays by an NSRange()
and one for subscripts of OODictionarys using a &quot;slice&quot; which is an
array of keys returning an array (each of which can be assigned to.)

<td width='50%' valign=top>
<h3>Caveats</h3>
<p>As with any framework built on top of an existing one there are a few minor
&quot;gotchas&quot; to look out for with using objcpp.h at the points where it
meets conventional Objective-C programming.</p>
<h4>Mutability</h4>
<p>objcpp.h does all it can to make sure its contained instances are mutable.
Normally when an assignment is made, all that happens is that the pointer is copied and a
&quot;retain&quot; message sent. If the assignment appears to be from an
immutable object however (such as from NSString * rather than NSMutableString *) a
&quot;mutableCopy&quot; is taken of the entire object and the copy is retained.</p>
<p>Also, note that in effect all objcpp.h core classes are based on the mutable
version of their foundation counterpart. If you want to make sure an argument
passed by reference to a function is not changed by that function use the
&quot;const&quot; qualifier, e.g. <tt>const OOString &amp;str</tt>.</p>
<h4>Scope and Memory Management</h4>
<p>objcpp.h is perhaps a little too efficient at managing memory at times. Consider the
following code:</p>
<pre>OOString greet( const OOString &amp;who ) {
    return OOString( @&quot;Hello &quot; )+who;
}
...
    NSString *message = greet( @&quot;World&quot; );
    NSLog( @&quot;%@&quot;, message );</pre>

<p>You will find it crashes. By the time the message is printed, the
temporary OOString instance C++ created on the stack as the return value from
function greet() has been destroyed and its containing string will have been
released. For this situation the &quot;&amp;&quot; operator has been overloaded
in the OOReference class to return the underlying pointer with &quot;<b>autorelease</b>&quot;
scope i.e.: 

<pre>operator &amp; () { return [[ref retain] autorelease]; }</pre>

The following code will work and the message object will be preserved for
delayed release.
<pre>    NSString *message = &amp;greet();
    NSLog( @&quot;%@&quot;, message );</pre>

You can use this in any situation where you need to retain a contained object a
little longer. Think of the &quot;*&quot; operator as &quot;object pointed to
by&quot; and the &quot;&amp;&quot; operator as &quot;take a pointer to&quot;.
<h4>Assign of nil vs. capacity.</h4>
<p>Unfortunately in Objective-C &quot;nil&quot; is defined as simply &quot;0&quot; and it is
impossible to distinguish it from integers when defining constructors. As it is
useful to have a constructor for OOArray where you can&nbsp; specify the size of
an array as well as one which initializes it to nil a compromise had to be
found. As a result there is a shared constructor for integer arguments. If the
value is zero it creates an empty OOArray reference. If the integer is non-null
it will actually allocate an array with that initial capacity. As constructors are
implemented using the assignment operators (to keep the two consistent) this
applies to assignment as well. A necessary evil alas. If in doubt you could look at using the &quot;~&quot; operator to destroy a variable
(or subscripted
reference) rather than assign &quot;nil&quot;.</p>
<h4>Strings</h4>
<p>You will find that in many places you can use C-style &quot;strings&quot; as
well as Objective-C style @&quot;strings&quot; work where an OOString is
expected. This is due to there being a constructor to convert from one to the
other. You may even find that there are places where C-style strings seem to work
better than Obj-C style @strings. This is because the expression&nbsp; <tt>@&quot;a
string&quot;</tt> has neither class NSString nor NSMutableString or even NCFString
and as a result can lead to compilation errors due to ambiguous overloading.&nbsp;If you encounter
problems use a C-Style &quot;string&quot; as it is less ambiguous.</p>
<h4>Debugging</h4>
<p>While on the whole use of objcpp.h does not affect the Xcode environment the
debugger &quot;gdb&quot; does not support inlined functions well when setting
breakpoints and single stepping. In order to get around this: #define the
preprocessor symbol &quot;<b>OODEBUG</b>&quot; in your source before objcpp.h is
#imported or as a build parameter in Xcode and objcpp.h will be built without inlining
functions. It can then be debugged as you would any other program. The last issue
worth mentioning is that for some reason OOArrays and OODictionarys always
display as being empty in the debugger. To work around this type &quot;po
array.ref&quot; or po &quot;dictionary.ref&quot; at the console to view their
contents.</p>

<td width='50%' valign=top style='border-left: 2px inset'>
<h3>Common Idioms</h3>
<p>Having opened the door to operator overloading through the use of C++ the
risk is great of descending into the depths of &quot;operator oriented&quot;
programming where code is &quot;write only&quot; as is best exemplified by a
language such as Perl which has an excessively rich syntax. There are a large
number of operators defined in objcpp.h but used in moderation the common
operators will not result in a reduction in the comprehensibility of code when
compared to their at-times very verbose alternatives in Objective-C.</p>
<p>Examples of common code idioms you might expect to use without compromising
maintainability are given below:</p>

<pre>
// String concatenation (init from C-string is OK)
OOString string1 = @&quot;Hello&quot;, string2 = &quot;World&quot;;
OOString greeting = string1+&quot; &quot;+string2;

// subscript into string
unichar character2 = greeting[1];
greeting[1] = 'a';

// String comparison
if ( greeting == &quot;Hallo World&quot; )
    // do something

// Pattern replace
greeting |= @&quot;/Hallo/Good-bye/&quot;;

// Pattern match
OOStringArray words = greeting &amp; @&quot;\\w+&quot;;

// Split string dividing by separator
OOStringArray words = greeting / @&quot; &quot;;

// Join string back together (obscure)
OOString greeting = words / @&quot; &quot;;

// Sort an array
OOStringArray sorted = +words;

// destroy variable (assign to nil)
~greeting;

// Array initialization from C-string
OOArray&lt;OOString&gt; array1 = &quot;1 2 3&quot;, array2 = &quot;3 4 5&quot;;

// set operators (OOStringArray is a synonym)
OOStringArray union = array | array2;
OOStringArray intersection = array1 &amp; array2;

// add to array
array1 += &quot;4&quot;;
array1 += array2

// dictionary operators (can also init from C-string)
OODictionary&lt;OOString&gt; dict = &quot;a 1 b 2 c 3&quot;;
dict[@&quot;d&quot;] = &quot;Hello&quot;;
