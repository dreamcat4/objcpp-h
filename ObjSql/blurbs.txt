409-56-7008~Bennet was the classic too-busy \
executive.  After discovering computer databases he now has the time to  \
run several successful businesses and sit on three major corporate  \
boards.  Bennet also donates time to community service organizations.  \
Miraculously, he also finds time to write and market executive-oriented  \
in-depth computer hardware and software reviews.  "I'm hyperkinetic,  \
so being dynamic and fast-moving is a piece of cake.  But being  \
organized isn't easy for me or for anyone I know.  There's just one  \
word for that: `databases!' Databases can cure you or kill you.  If you  \
get the right one, you can be like me.  If you get the wrong one, watch  \
out.  Read my book!"
486-29-1786~If Chastity Locksley didn't  \
exist, this troubled world would have created her!  Not only did she  \
master the mystic secrets of inner strength to conquer adversity when  \
she encountered it in life, but, after "reinventing herself", as she \
says, by writing "Emotional Security: A New Algorithm" following the \
devastating loss of her cat Old Algorithm, she also founded Publish or \
Perish, the page-by-page, day-by-day, write-yourself-to-wellness \
encounter workshops franchise empire, the better to share her inspiring \
discoveries with us all.  Her "Net Etiquette," a brilliant social \
treatise in its own right and a fabulous pun, is the only civilized \
alternative to the gross etiquette often practiced on the public \
networks.
648-92-1872~A chef's chef and a raconteur's \
raconteur, Reginald Blotchet-Halls calls London his second home. "Th' \
palace kitchen's me first 'ome, act'lly!" Blotchet-Halls' astounding \
ability to delight our palates with palace delights is matched only by \
his equal skill in satisfying our perpetual hunger for delicious \
back-stairs gossip by serving up tidbits and entrees literally fit for \
a king!
672-71-3249~They asked me to write about \
myself and my book, so here goes:  I started a restaurant called "de \
Gustibus" with two of my friends.  We named it that because you really \
can't discuss taste.  We're very popular with young business types \
because we're young business types ourselves.  Whenever we tried to go \
out to eat in a group we always got into these long tiresome \
negotiations: "I just ate Italian," or "I ate Greek yesterday," or \
I NEVER eat anything that's not organic!"  Inefficient.  Not what \
business needs today.  So, it came to us that we needed a restaurant we \
could all go to every day and not eat the same thing twice in a row \
maybe for a year!  We thought, "Hey, why make people choose one kind \
of restaurant over another, when what they really want is a different \
kind of food?"  At de Gustibus you can eat Italian, Chinese, Japanese, \
Greek, Russian, Tasmanian, Iranian, and on and on all at the same \
time.  You never have to choose.  You can even mix and match!  We just \
pooled our recipes, opened the doors, and never looked back.  We're a \
big hit, what can I say?  My recipes in "Sushi, Anyone?" are used at \
de Gustibus.  They satisfy crowds for us every day.  They will work for \
you, too.  Period!
899-46-2035~Anne Ringer ran away from the \
circus as a child.  A university creative writing professor and her \
family took Anne in and raised her as one of their own.  In this warm \
and television-less setting she learned to appreciate the great \
classics of literature.  The stream of aspiring and accomplished \
writers that flowed constantly through the house confirmed her \
repudiation of the circus family she'd been born into: "Barbarians!" \
The steadily growing recognition of her literary work was, to her, \
vindication.  When her brother's brush with death brought them together \
after many years, she took advantage of life's crazy chance thing and \
broke the wall of anger that she had constructed to separate them. \
Together they wrote, "Is Anger the Enemy?" an even greater \
blockbuster than her other collaborative work, with Michel DeFrance, \
"The Gourmet Microwave."
998-72-3567~Albert Ringer was born \
in a trunk to circus parents, but another kind of circus trunk played a \
more important role in his life years later.  He grew up as an \
itinerant wrestler and roustabout in the reknowned Ringer Brothers and \
Betty and Bernie's Circus.  Once known in the literary world only as \
Anne Ringer's wrestling brother, he became a writer while recuperating \
from a near-fatal injury received during a charity benefit bout with a \
gorilla.  "Slingshotting" himself from the ring ropes, Albert flew \
over the gorilla's head and would have landed head first on the \
concrete.  He was saved from certain death by Nana, an elephant he \
befriended as a child, who caught him in her trunk.  Nana held him so \
tightly that three ribs cracked and he turned blue from lack of \
oxygen.  "I was delirious.  I had an out-of-body experience!  My whole \
life passed before me.  I promised myself 'If I get through this, I'll \
use my remaining time to share what I learned out there.'  I owe it all \
to Nana!"
